**_NOTE:_** _Tsumugi Shiraui is a chimera: a hybrid of Human and Gauna. She combines the chaotic power of Gauna with a Human intillegence and empathia. Like an original character of the Manga "Knights of Sidonia", this project aims to make a hybrid of very powerful but hard to learn and use Deequ Scala Library with a usability and simplicity of Spark Connect (PySpark Connect, Spark Connect Go, Spark Connect Rust, etc.)._
